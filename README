To compile:
==========

You will need Flex 4 or later installed into FLEX_HOME. Just invoke build.sh.

To try it local:
===============
If you plan to test Flash components using static html files, create
a file like:

~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#Security/FlashPlayerTrust/myproject.cfg

With a line inside like this:
/home/<username>

(Adjust to Windows accordingly). This will tell Flash that any file inside the 
/home/<username> folder is trusted and will enable the communication between
javascript and Flash.
